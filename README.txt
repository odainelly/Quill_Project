    LITTLE BIT OF FLEXBOX GUIDANCE AND WHYS

/*  from what i have gathered about flexbox is 
    looks like justify content when used on the flex-container deals with aligning things 
    along a height , this does not work when there is no space in the flex-container for the 
    flex-items to be moved.(at least that is what i think )
    meanwhile align-items deals with width type and works even when the container has no set height or width

*/

you can work with both justify-content and align-items to achieve almost any desired 
results you seek
